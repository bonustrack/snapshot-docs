# Create a space with ENS

*If you already have a space, see [instructions for migrating to ENS](./migrate-your-space-to-ens.md)*

### 1. Get an ENS domain for your space

If you don't have an ENS domain yet for your space you will need to register one. If you need help follow the registrar  guide.

**Register ENS domain**  
[https://app.ens.domains](https://app.ens.domains/)

**DNS registrar guide**  
[https://docs.ens.domains/dns-registrar-guide](https://docs.ens.domains/dns-registrar-guide)

### 2. Link your ENS domain to Snapshot with "contenthash"

Once you have created your domain ENS, go on this url using your domain for space name. [https://snapshot.page/\#/**my-space.eth**/settings](https://snapshot.page/#/my-space.eth/settings)

{% hint style="info" %}
Change **my-space.eth** with your ENS domain and **login** with the wallet owner of the domain name.

 **&lt;your-adress&gt;** will automatically be replaced by your address when you log in.
{% endhint %}

If you are on your domain space and connected with your wallet copy the "IPNS link" in the "ENS" field and click on the button **Set record on ENS**, you will get redirected to ENS app.

On the ENS app click on **ADD/EDIT RECORD** and paste the "IPNS link" in the "CONTENT" field.

Click **Confirm** and submit the change.

### **3. Setup your space settings**

Refresh the Snapshot settings page https://snapshot.page/\#/my-space.eth/settings. Now you can edit your space settings.

#### Profile

* **Change avatar** is detailed in the paragraph "Add your space logo and strategy image\(s\)".
* **Name** is the name that will be displayed in the snapshot application.
* **Network** must be the network relative to your token.
* **Symbol** is the your main token symbol that will be displayed in your space.
* **Skin** can be left as a default, used as an existing one or you can create your own.
* **Domain name** is optional and must be configured as specified in the [custom domain](custom-domain.md) section.

#### **Strategies**

You need to add a voting strategy for your proposals. You can choose one by default and edit it by clicking on it to configure your own token in it or keep the default token. For more information on strategies, please refer to the [Strategies](../strategies.md) section.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can add up to 3 strategies in your space.
{% endhint %}

![Edit strategies on Snapshot.](../.gitbook/assets/capture-de-cran-2020-12-20-a-12.19.09.png)

#### Members and Filters

* **Members** are those who can create official proposals that will be displayed in the "Core" tab. You can add as many addresses as you need, one per line.
* **Default tab** is the one that will be displayed as the default for your space. For example `all` `core` or `community`
* **Minimum score** is the minimum number of tokens required to create a proposal.
* **Only members proposals** is used to allow only members to post proposals and can be set to `true` or `false`
* **Invalids** are the proposals you want to hide from your space. You can add as many proposal ids as you need, one per line.

![Configure the organisation and permissions of the proposals.](../.gitbook/assets/capture-de-cran-2020-12-20-a-12.25.49.png)

Click **Save** and **sign settings message** on your wallet.

![Save your Snapshot space settings.](../.gitbook/assets/capture-de-cran-2020-12-20-a-12.43.25.png)

Now you are set! You can go on https://snapshot.page/\#/my-space.eth to see your space.

{% hint style="info" %}
When you create or edit a space, it take about 3min to see the changes live.
{% endhint %}

### **4. Add your space logo and strategy image\(s\)**

To get a logo for your space and images for the strategies you need to do a pull request on this repository [https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-spaces](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-spaces). You will need to create a folder with the id of your space \(example: "my-space.eth"\). In this folder you need a file "space.png" and "logo.png" \(for the first strategy\) and "logo1.png" if you have a second strategy. All the images must be squared and less than 50kb.
